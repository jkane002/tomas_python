        "The enemy movement tutorial is based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc1pJ8XdZa0 (15 min) and the code is found [here](https://github.com/techwithtim/Pygame-Tutorials/blob/master/Game/Tutorial%20%236.py). This will be an overview to enemy movement so for more details, research on your own.\n",
        "## Steps\n",
        "In general, you will automate the enemies' movements by changing the velocity after a certain time frame or once they reach a destination. You can set hit boxes on the enemies and on their weapons so when the player collides with them, they lose health or die. These are general steps that would be need to be taken.\n",
        "1. Design your enemy character. Ideally have a sprite sheet for every movement for animating.\n",
        "2. Create a list of loading images. You can retrieve the index for a particular movement. (i.e. right foot forward is at index 1, we need the character to move his right foot, load image at index 1)\n",
        "3. Create a move function for the enemy. This will automatically move your character from left to right. Simply check if the velocity is negative then allow the character to move left and vice versa.\n",
        "4. You can create a `walkCount` variable determining how far you want the enemy to move.\n",
        "5. Create a draw function that indexes the sprite sheet to get the correct character movement. The direction can be checked by determining if the velocity is positive or negative.\n",
        "6. For enemy weapons, you can shoot \"fireballs\" at random time intervals using the random module. (This can be done at another time.)"
