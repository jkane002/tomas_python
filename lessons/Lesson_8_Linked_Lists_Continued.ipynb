        "\n",
        "Removing an element is a bit more complex than usual. Imagine there is a row of people linking hands. \n",
        "\n",
        "Each person is a node and their arms are links. As you can imagine, the last person in line is holding no one so that represents a node referencing to None. \n",
        "\n",
        "What happens when a person in line removes themself? How does the line remain intact without letting go of their hands?\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's call the person that needs to be removed: Taylor.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The person to the left of Taylor lets go of his hands and links with the person to the right of Taylor.\n",
        "2. Now Taylor can let go of both people and the line remains intact.\n",
        "\n",
        "These steps are critical when dealing with linked lists as you always want to keep the linked list intact either through temporary variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "So that example was for removing an element somewhere in a linked list. Pause here and think of ways to remove an element when it is the first node and the last node.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Iterate through the linked list to find the element to remove. O(n)\n",
        "2. Create variables called previous assigned to None and current assigned to head.\n",
        "3. Next, iterate through the loop while checking if the data is what we need to remove.\n",
        "4. Advance the loop by setting current to current's next and previous to current.\n",
        "5. The loop exits once the current's data is identical to the data that we need to remove.\n",
        "6. Outside the loop, we now check if current is at the head or at other places.\n",
        "7. If the previous is None meaning we are at the beginning of the linked list, set the head to current's next.\n",
        "8. Otherwise, check if the current is not None then set previous' next to current's next, and current's next to None.\n",
