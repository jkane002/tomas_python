        "A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer. Python does not have linked lists in its standard library. We will implement the concept of linked lists using the concept of nodes. We are going to study the types of linked lists known as singly linked lists. In this type of data structure there is only one link between any two data elements. We create such a list and create additional methods to insert, update and remove elements from the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each element of a linked list is called a node, and every node has two different fields:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Data** contains the value to be stored in the node.\n",
        "* **Next** contains a reference to the next node on the list.\n",

        "\n",
        "A linked list is a collection of nodes. The first node is called the head, and it’s used as the starting point for any iteration through the list. If you delete the head, you delete everything so be careful! The last node must have its next reference pointing to None to determine the end of the list. \n",
        "\n",
        "In most programming languages, there are clear differences in the way linked lists and arrays are stored in memory. In Python, however, lists are dynamic arrays. That means that the memory usage of both lists and linked lists is very similar. Python’s list type is implemented as a dynamic array—which means it doesn’t suit the typical scenarios where you’d want to use a “proper” linked list data structure for performance reasons.\n",
        "\n",
        "Important take aways:\n",
        "* In memory, it is not contiguous like arrays. These \"pointers\" can point to different data in other parts of memory.\n",

        "* Usually needs another class like Node to be implemented. \n",
        "* In Python, lists and linked lists are similar because they are dynamic arrays. However to understand how linked lists work in general as well in other programming languages, we will implement our own linked list."
