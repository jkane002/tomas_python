        "We will create a user registration form on the front-end of our website. We need this because we don't want to share our admin page to random users. If you don't want other users joining this website, this concept is great to learn about form creation.\n",
        "## User App\n",
        "1. `python manage.py startapp users`: Go to Git Bash. The user account portion for our project is going to have its own forms, templates, and routes that are logically separate from the blog itself. We would need a new app for the user registration where it's contained in its own section.\n",
        "2. Do you remember what we need to do when we created a new app? We need to add it to our installed apps list in our project settings. Go to the project settings file and add this in: `'users.apps.UsersConfig',`\n",
        "\n",
        "> What is the purpose of doing this again?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Let's start with the view that will handle the logic for this register route. Open `users/views.py` and start by defining a register view function like so:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "def register(request):\n",
        "```\n",
        "4. Now we need to create a form that we will pass to the template. We can make a form from scratch but that will take a long time because we need to do many validation checks for emails, passwords. This process is too common and we don't want to reinvent it. Luckily in Django, we can create Python classes and these classes generate HTML forms for us. Simply import this from Django:\n",
        "`from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm`\n",
        "\n",
        "* Let's take a look at the documentation for this: [UserCreationForm](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. `form = UserCreationForm()`- In the register function, create an instance of the form\n",
        "6. `return render(request, 'users/register.html', {'form': form})` - Now let's render a template that uses this form. This template doesn't exist yet but we'll create it in a bit.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Explain what render does.\n",
        "* **1st param**: request - Remember that we always need a request argument. Django essentially requests access to the provided html.\n",
        "* **2nd param**: html - Once Django's request is granted, it searches for the html page to render.\n",
        "* **3rd param**: context - Explain what is a context dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Hint: Remember this format for your final exam.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Create a folder in the users directory called `templates` and within the the templates folder create another folder called `users`. Now in `users/`, create a file called `register.html`\n",
        "8. Similarly to our previous files, we will need to extend the base template and then fill in our content block. Copy the below code into `register.html`\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "{% extends \"blog/base.html\" %}\n",

        "9. `<form method=\"POST\"></form>` - Put this in between the divs. So remember we are creating a form where users can register to join.  POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.\n",
        "10. `{% csrf_token %}`- We need to add something called a CSRF token. This is a hidden tag provided by Django that protects our form against certain attacks. Without this, it won't work. Put this in between the form tags.\n",
        "11. `<fieldset></fieldset>` - Create fieldset tags. Recall that fields collect user input. We need to collect users' information. Inside fieldset put `class=form-group`.\n",
        "12. `<legend>Join Today</legend>` - The `<legend>` tag defines a caption for the `<fieldset>` element. Provide `class=\"border-bottom mb-4\"` This creates a border at the bottom and provides a margin of 4. Click [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41574776/what-is-class-mb-0-in-bootstrap-4) to learn more about this.\n",
        "13. `{{ form.as_p }}` - Below the legend, we will print out our form so we can simply access that form through the variable passed. As_p just denotes the form to be in paragraph form.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Submit Button\n",
        "14. Below the fieldset tags, create opening and closing tags for a `<div>` with the class `\"form-group\"`.\n",
        "15. Now within the div tags, create `<button>` tags with the class `\"btn btn-outline-info\"` and a type called `\"submit\"`. Now within the button tags type in Sign Up. This will be displayed on the button.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Already have an account?\n",
        "16. Below the form tags, create opening and closing `<divs>`. Give a class of `\"border-top pt-3\"`. This provides a border at the top with padding of 3.\n",
        "17. Within those divs, create opening and closing `<small>` tags with a class of `\"text-muted\"`. Within the small tags, type in Already have an account?\n",
        "18. Now below that create `<a>` tags with a class of `\"ml-2\"` and an href of `\"#\"`. This provides a margin left of 2 and a hypertext reference to pound which means nothing as of now. Within those `<a>` tags, type in `Sign In`.\n",
