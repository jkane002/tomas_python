Now databases are a different/complex topic so let's just keep it at a high-level. Django uses `db.sqlite` (See-Quill-Light) and now we are going to use a PostgreSQL (Post-Gress-Cue-Ell) database. As a high-level concept, just know they are two different databases but Postgres is better for production.\n",

        "14. The error just means we need to migrate our changes to the database. We don't need to make our migrations because the migrations are already pushed to Heroku. We just need to migrate them. Ensure you are in Git Bash at the root of the directory and type in - `heroku run python manage.py migrate`. `heroku run` runs a command on Heroku.\n",

        "DEBUG = (os.environ.get(\"DEBUG_VALUE\") == \"True\")`\n",
        "* This gets the environment variable and returns True only if it is True. Otherwise, DEBUG will be False.\n",
