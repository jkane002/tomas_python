        "As seen recently, we couldn't tell what was wrong with our registration form when we entered a commonly used password. We need another way to notify the user. Also, why couldn't the user enter their email? We are using Django's default `UserCreationForm` where it just provides a username and password field. We will create our own form to provide an email field. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Register a user's email\n",
        "1. Within the user's folder, create a file called `forms.py`. We are going to create our first form that inherits from `UserCreationForm`.\n",
        "2. `from django import forms` - This is form module provided by Django that sets up a simple form template. \n",
        "3. `from django.contrib.auth.models import User` - Now we need to import User so we can attach the User model to the form.\n",
        "4. `from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm` - A ModelForm for creating a new user.\n",
        "It has three fields: username (from the user model), password1, and password2. It verifies that password1 and password2 match, validates the password using validate_password(), and sets the user’s password using set_password().\n",
        "5. `class UserRegisterForm(UserCreationForm):` - Let's create a class that inherits from `UserCreationForm`. We need to inherit this bceause we need Django's standard fields including username and password.\n",
        "6. `email = forms.EmailField()` - This creates a field for the email. \n",
        "7. `class Meta:` - This is a bit strange but this class is within the UserRegisterForm. This essentially encapsulates or wraps the following data. It keeps these configurations in one place.\n",
        "8. `model = User` - We want the form to interact with the User model because it will create a new user.\n",
        "9. `fields = ['username', 'email', 'password1', 'password2']` - These are the fields that will be shown on our form.\n",
        "10. Return to `users/views.py` and let's import our register form like this - `from .forms import UserRegisterForm`.\n",
        "11. We will use `UserRegisterForm` instead of `UserCreationForm` so look in the file and replace them. There are 2 of them. \n",
        "12. Since we aren't using the `UserCreationForm` we can delete the import at the top.\n",
        "13. Now return to Git Bash and run the server. Let's register a new user at `localhost:8000/register`. Check the admin page.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Crispy Forms\n",
        "We are going to overhaul the style of our register form so it looks similar to [this](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/182a9b1c4fc34f43b2c986dd6ed554ed793f5905/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4c535245672e706e67). It doesn't have our BootStrap styling and we don't need all of the validation information displayed so large. Also we don't have a way to boldly display error messages. Crispy forms allow us to build programmatic reusable layouts out of components, having full control of the rendered HTML without writing HTML in templates. All this without breaking the standard way of doing things in Django, so it plays nice with any other form application.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. `pip install django-crispy-forms` - First, we need to install Crispy forms. So return to Git Bash and enter this command.\n",
        "15. Now whenever we install a new app, we need to tell Django that this is an installed app. So go to the project's setting's module. Enter `'crispy_forms',` in the list.\n",
        "16. Let's also tell crispy form to use the most recent Bootstrap version to use. Go to the very bottom and enter `CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4'`\n",
        "17. Next, we need to load this template and use it. Return to `register.html` and at the top right below `{% extends...` load in the crispy form tags by entering `{% load crispy_forms_tags %}`\n",
        "18. Now we can use crispy forms with any forms that we have. Replace `{{ form.as_p }}` with `{{ form|crispy }}`. The bar represents a filter. So first we establish a form and filter it so we can use a crispy form.\n",
        "19. Let's run it on the server. \n",
        "20. Go to the register page again and inspect the page. Try enter an existing user. What happens?"

        "22. Now in the urlpatterns list, include `path('login/',auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='users/login.html'), name='login')`. Just note that `LoginView` is a class based view, we will look at those later on. The `as_view()` simply casts the class into view with the provided template.

        "24. So let's create the login template first. Create a file called `login.html` in `users/templates/users`. How do we want the login page to look? We simply want a page where the user enters their username and password. Django will do the checks to see if they exist in our database and all the other checks.\n",
        "25. This will be very similar to the register template so simply copy all the code into the `login.html`. Great! we already have a form set up.\n",

        "31. We want the user to login and be redirected to the home page. To fix this, open the project's `settings.py` and scroll to the very bottom. Include this - `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'blog-home'`\n",
        "32. Let's check it out. Go to `localhost:8000/login` and log in again. For now, there are no visuals letting us know we logged in but we will fix that later on.\n",
        "33. Check if we are logged in by going to `localhost:8000/admin` and we should see the admin site.\n",
        "34. Let's change the register route so users are redirected to the log in page. Go to the users' `views.py`. Change the success message from \"Account create for username\" to \"Your account has been created! You are able to log in\" and change the redirect to `redirect('login')`\n",

        "37. Now above that div tag, insert this: `<h2>You have been logged out</h2>`\n",
