        "* models.Model represents a database field like similar to `Please enter a title name`\n",
        "15. `title = models.CharField(max_length=100)` - To enter a title we use a character field with a max length of 100 characters. Our title needs to be short so we are restricting it to that amount. \n",
        "16. `content = models.TextField()` - Our content can have multiple lines of sentences so a text field with no restrictions is reasonable.\n",
        "17. `date_posted = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)` - The date posted has a date time field which will represent the default time as `September 27, 2020`. To use the default datetime in our timezone, we need to import timezone. So at the top include this: `from django.utils import timezone`\n",
        "18. `from django.contrib.auth.models import User` - Add this to the top. We already have a user model as shown in the previous concept. We need to import that model so we can use it with our posts.\n",
        "19. `author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete = models.CASCADE)` - Add this to our class. A foreign key allows the user to create many posts but a post can't be created by multiple users. `User` denotes the imported User. `on_delete` shows what happens if a user is deleted. `models.CASCADE` deletes the posts created by that user. This is needed because if you delete a post, you won't delete a user.\n",
        "20. `def __str__(self):` - This is a string method to represent an object of the class Post. How can we represent a post? We use its title. So for this method `return self.title`\n",

        "25. `admin.site.register(Post)` - This registers the Post module onto the admin site.\n",
        "26. Now go to `blog/views.py`. We are going to let go of creating our posts in the view and now using the admin page to create posts for now.\n",
        "27. `import .models from Post` - Add this to the very top. This is to import posts into our views page.\n",
        "28. `'posts': Post.objects.all()` - Edit the context dictionary in the home function so it looks like this. Post is a model so we need to return all objects represented. We won't be using the list of posts anymore so delete it.\n",
