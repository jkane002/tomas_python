        "## Objective\n",
        "Our blog site will eventually contain many posts and we need a way to contain them. With pagination, we can limit the number of posts per page. \n",
        "## Pagination\n",
        "1. Look at the ListView's documentation [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/pagination/#paginating-a-listview). \n",
        "2. So you saw that we can paginate our posts using the `paginate_by` variable. Go to the blog's views.py page and under the PostListView class, include this `paginate_by = 2`.\n",
        "* This limits the amount of posts per page by 2.\n",
        "3. Go to the browser and check this out. Create more posts with different users to see the difference.\n",
        "4. Now we need a way to switch between different pages. You can actually do this manually by going to `localhost:8000/?page=2`\n",
        "5. Go to `home.html` under `blog/templates/blog`. We will edit this file because this is where our posts are being rendered.\n",
        "6. Between `endfor` and `endblock content` include this if statement:\n",
        "```\n",
        "{% if is_paginated %}\n",
        "{% endif %}\n",
        "```\n",
        "* By giving the ListView a paginated_by variable, this automatically sets the `is_paginated` to True thanks to Django.\n",
        "7. Now in between that if statement, create this nested if statement:\n",
        "```\n",
        "{% if page_obj.has_previous %}\n",
        "{% endif %}\n",
        "```\n",
        "* So overall, first it checks if the ListView is paginated then it checks if the current page has a previous page. (i.e You're on page 2. The current page has a previous page at page 1). If you're wondering where `page_obj` came from, by including `paginate_by` in the ListView, Django enables us to use that variable.\n",
        "8. In between, the nested if statement include this:\n",
        "```\n",
        "<a class=\"btn btn-outline-info mb-4\" href=\"?page=1\">First</a>\n",
        "<a class=\"btn btn-outline-info mb-4\" href=\"?page={{ page_obj.previous_page_number }}\">Previous</a>\n",
        "```\n",
        "* The first line will provide a hyperlinked button that will always go to the first page.\n",
        "* The second line will provide a hyperlinked button that will always go to the previous page.\n",
        "9. Now we want to display a range of pages. For example, if we are on page 5, there will be buttons for pages 3 and 4 and page 6 and 7. This will change depending on the current page.\n",
        "10. Below the `if page_obj.has_previous ` statement, let's create a for loop that iterates through all the pages.\n",
        "```\n",
        "{% for num in page_obj.paginator.page_range %}\n",
        "{% endfor %}\n",
        "```\n",
        "* Iterate through a page object (the ListView) with a paginator (object containing all the posts) that states the range (size of the list).\n",
        "11. Next, in the for loop we will have an if and an else if statement to see which pages to render for the buttons. Type it out.\n",
        "So our first if statement looks like this:\n",
        "```\n",
        "{% if page_obj.number == num %}\n",
        "      <a class=\"btn btn-info mb-4\" href=\"?page={{ num }}\">{{ num }}</a>\n",
        "{% endif %}\n",
        "```\n",
        "* This simply checks if the page we are on matches with num. If it is, provide the href with the current number and display a button with the current number as well. We also made this button a solid color by omitting `outline`.\n",
        "12. Now for the else-if statement, we provide the page range. Type this out so you can understand it more.\n",
        "```\n",
        "{% elif num > page_obj.number|add:'-3' and num < page_obj.number|add:'3' %}\n",
        "        <a class=\"btn btn-outline-info mb-4\" href=\"?page={{ num }}\">{{ num }}</a>\n",
        "```\n",
        "* This prints numbers surrounding the current page. Check if num is greater than the current page and within 3 previous, then render the buttons. Do this similarly when num is less than the current page. The `|` (pipe) filters our command.\n",
        "13. Outside the for loop, let's display buttons for the next page numbers. This if statement is very similar to the has_previous if statement\n",
        "```\n",
        "{% if page_obj.has_next %}\n",
        "        <a class=\"btn btn-outline-info mb-4\" href=\"?page={{ page_obj.next_page_number }}\">Next</a>\n",
        "        <a class=\"btn btn-outline-info mb-4\" href=\"?page={{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages }}\">Last</a>\n",
        "{% endif %}\n",
        "```\n",
        "* First, it checks if the page has a page that follows. If so, it displays the next page number as well as the very last page using `{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages }`\n",
        "14. Let's check it out on the browser. Flip through the pages.\n",
        "15. Now let's change the `paginate_by` variable to something bigger like 5 to display more posts. This is in the views.py file.\n",
        "16. Overall, the code should look like this. Explain what each line does."
