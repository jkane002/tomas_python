        "Finally, we will create a receiver function for a Django signal that will make sure our profiles are created when a user first registers. So whenever a new user registers to our site, they also will make a profile.\n",
        "## What are they? \n",
        "\n",
        "Signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place. They’re especially useful when many pieces of code may be interested in the same events. \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we don't want to sit outside all day and wait for the postal service to drop off mail. The mailman can signal there is mail by raising the mailbox flag. If the flag is down, then there is no mail. \n",
        "\n",
        "1. In the users directory, create a file called `signals.py`. This is outside of the templates folder because we want other models to access these signals.\n",
        "44. Import the following - \n",
        "```\n",
        "from django.db.models.signals import post_save\n",
        "from django.contrib.auth.models import User\n",
        "from django.dispatch import receiver\n",
        "from .models import Profile\n",
        "```\n",
        "* `post_save` - This is a signal that gets fired after an object is saved. We need this when a user is created.\n",
        "* `User` - This will be the \"sender\" that sends the signal.\n",
        "* `receiver` - A receiver receives the signal and performs some tasks.\n",
        "* `Profile` - We need this Profile model since we will be creating a model. \n",
        "\n",
        "So remember our objective, we need a signaling mechanism to signal a new user registration that creates a new profile.\n",
        "3. `def create_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):` - This function creates a profile for each new user.\n",
        "46. Inside this function, include the following - \n",
        "```\n",
        " if created:\n",
        "        Profile.objects.create(user=instance)\n",
        "```\n",
        "* This simply states if a user is created, create a profile under this user instance.\n",
        "4. Include this decorator on top of the create_profile function - \n",
        "```\n",
        "@receiver(post_save, sender=User)\n",
        "```\n",
        "* It takes the signal and sends it to the sender or the User. When a user is saved, then send this signal. Once the receiver receives that signal, it goes through the function to create a profile given a created user. Overall, just know that a signal is needed from the user creation part in order to create a profile.\n",
        "5. Now we need a function that saves the profile given the same signal direction - \n",
        "```\n",
        "@receiver(post_save, sender=User)\n",
        "def save_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):\n",
        "    instance.profile.save()\n",
        "```\n",
        "* The decorator is similar where it needs a signal from the User to create a profile.\n",
        "* The instance saves the profile created.\n",
        "6. Now we need to import our signals inside a ready function to explicitly tell Django that we are ready for signals to be received and sent. So go to `apps.py` under the users directory.\n",
        "50. Inside the UsersConfig class, created this new method - \n",
        "```\n",
        "def ready(self):\n",
        "        import users.signals\n",
        "```\n",
        "* As it's stated, the ready method is called once Django is ready to receive or send signals then it imports them.\n",
        "8. Now let's go to the browser, register a new user, and check out their profile."
